	Dear-diary :memo:
</h1> 
With time, many of us lost interest or dont have time to write diary or atleast maintain a diary at home. As the technology progress and many things have been digitalzied.. so why not diary? Dear-diary is a tool to write your diaries every day without needing to write your stuff in text files, because diary writing is a good habit.

## Features:

1. Create note.
2. View Bunch of notes.
3. View individual notes.

## Why did you build this? :thinking:

I have been note-taking for as long as I started using my laptop. I use notes mostly for technical stuff, but these days I am using notes to record all kinds of information like journals, ideas, snippets etc. In my career, I have tried a number of note-taking tools like OneNote, Evernote, Google Keep etc. But I have never been satisfied with them mainly because - 

1. I don't have any control over how or where my notes are stored. - What if the company closes or the developer stops building the product?
2. Most of these services are paid or work on only certain Operating Systems.

Because of these reasons, I had to lose my notes a number of times and was forced to start from scratch. This was frustrating, and finally, I decided to do something about it. The result is this project. Sure it might not be as polished as all those premium note-taking tools, but it works and that too in the way I want it to.
